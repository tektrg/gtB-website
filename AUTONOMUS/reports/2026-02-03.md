# AUTONOMUS Daily Report — 2026-02-03

## Shipped
1) **SEO + conversion blocks for every blog post**
- Added always-on in-article conversion section:
  - “Try this in GPT Breeze (2 minutes)” steps
  - “Add to Chrome” CTA + “Getting started” CTA
- Added optional per-post **FAQ block** (frontmatter-driven) + **FAQPage schema**

2) **SEO hygiene + verification**
- Fixed `npm run check` failures (TS + content schema)
- Added `public/robots.txt`
- Added `AUTONOMUS/scripts/verify_site_basics.mjs` and `AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_acronyms.mjs` (BYOM/BYOK consistency)

3) **Language consistency (BYOM vs BYOK)**
- Updated multiple posts to use **BYOM** as primary wording with a single alias mention.
- Kept the BYOK-focused post (GPT-4o BYOK guide) as BYOK-primary.

## Evidence / Verification
- `npm run check` → **0 errors** (exit code 0)
- `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_acronyms.mjs` → **OK**
- Diff highlights:
  - `src/content/config.ts` (blog schema extended)
  - `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro` (canonical fallback + conversion blocks + FAQ schema)
  - `src/pages/shortcuts/index.astro` (typed reduce accumulator)
  - `public/robots.txt`

## Next (queued)
- Add a lightweight internal-linking helper: auto-insert 2–3 “Continue reading” links based on tags (within article body, not only footer)
- Standardize CTA copy + styling across landing pages (not just blog)
- Create a script to ensure every blog post has:
  - description
  - at least 2 internal links
  - at least 1 CTA
  - optional FAQ (recommended)

---

## Extra (test-run task @ 20:38)
- Implemented internal link verifier: `AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_internal_links.mjs` (requires >=2 internal links per blog post)
- Patched posts that had 0–1 internal links by adding a "Continue reading" section with 3 internal links:
  - `byom-api-keys-vs-subscriptions.md`
  - `gpt-4.1-nano-pricing-guide.md`
  - `gpt-5-nano-pricing-guide.md`
  - `grammarly-alternatives.md`
  - `how-to-get-video-transcripts-with-gpt-breeze-extension.md`
  - `local-llms-with-gpt-breeze.md`

### Verification
- `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_internal_links.mjs` → OK
- `npm run check` → OK (0 errors)
