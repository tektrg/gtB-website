# 2026-02-08 — Nightly ship (SEO ops)

## Shipped
- **Internal link improvement**: Added a prominent link from the pillar post **“What is BYOM (Bring Your Own Model)?”** to the newer **power-user setup** article.
  - Change: `src/content/blog/what-is-byom-ai.md`
  - Link target: `/blog/byom-ai-extension-power-user-guide/`

## Why
- Strengthen internal linking from an older, high-intent BYOM explainer to the **“BYOM AI extension” power-user workflow** page (persona alignment: power users, keyword focus: “BYOM AI extension”).

## Verification
- `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_internal_links.mjs` → **OK** (all posts have >= 2 internal links)
- `npm run check` (astro check) → **0 errors** (only existing hints/warnings)

## Notes
- `bird`/cookies stuff is unrelated; no site changes beyond the internal-link addition.
