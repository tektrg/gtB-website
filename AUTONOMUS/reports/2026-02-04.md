# AUTONOMUS Daily Report — 2026-02-04

## Shipped (manual run @ 11:20)
- Added generator script: `AUTONOMUS/scripts/add_continue_reading.mjs`
  - Purpose: if any blog post has <2 internal links, automatically insert/update a `## Continue reading` block that links to the newest posts.
- Verification ran:
  - `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_internal_links.mjs` → OK
  - `npm run check` → OK (0 errors)

## Evidence
- `add_continue_reading.mjs` output: `Done. Changed 0 file(s).`
- `check_internal_links.mjs` output: `OK: all posts have >= 2 internal links.`

## Notes
- No files were changed today because yesterday’s patch already brought all posts above the internal-link minimum.

## Next
- Make internal-link suggestions **tag-aware** (BYOM cluster first, then newest).
- Add a verifier to ensure every post has at least 1 FAQ block (recommended for PAA).
