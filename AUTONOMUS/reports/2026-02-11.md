## What shipped
- Added a tighter **BYOM setup CTA** to the BYOM extensions comparison guide, linking directly to our setup guides (Getting Started + OpenRouter).
- Added a **"Next steps" internal-link block** at the end of the BYOM vs subscription article to drive readers into setup + the comparison guide.
