# 2026-02-09 — Nightly ship (2am)

## What shipped

### 1) Fix: consistent BYOM terminology (single BYOK alias mention)
- File: `src/content/blog/byom-ai-extension-power-user-guide.md`
- Change: removed repeated BYOK acronym usage in FAQ; kept BYOM as primary term and only a single BYOK alias mention on-page.
- Why: aligns with our editorial constraint (“pick one primary term per page; mention alias once”).

## Verifiers
- `npm run check` → **PASS** (0 errors)
- `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_internal_links.mjs` → **PASS**
- `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/verify_site_basics.mjs` → **PASS**
- `node AUTONOMUS/scripts/check_acronyms.mjs` → **PASS** (after fix)

## Notes
- This was a small hygiene ship (terminology consistency) to reduce SEO confusion and keep the BYOM pages aligned.
