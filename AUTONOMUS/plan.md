# AUTONOMUS Plan

## Operating mode

- Daily: complete 1-2 tasks; record here.
- Verify output with AUTONOMUS tools before shipping.

## Backlog (initial)

- Define holistic SEO strategy + communication contract (see `AUTONOMUS/strategy.md`).
- Baseline SEO audit and publish a report.
- Identify 5 new blog pillar opportunities from existing content gaps.
- Expand topic bank to 30–100 topics (mapped to pillars + intent).
- Add internal linking map from blog to product pages.
- Create content brief templates for new posts.

## Backlog (provider pillar)

- Build an "AI Providers" pillar + per-provider setup guides, sourced from src/data/models-api.json.
- Automate provider queue (prioritize popular providers first).
- Add a daily chore stream: internal link maintenance + safe year rollover updates.

## Daily log
- 2026-02-17: strict de-dup policy: kept canonical `src/content/blog/byom-ai-security-checklist-for-browser-extensions.md` and replaced `-2/-3/-4` duplicates with 301 redirects; added publish ledger `AUTONOMUS/state/published.jsonl`; added `AUTONOMUS/strategy.md`.

- 2026-02-04: Initialized AUTONOMUS folder + SEO verification tool; added daily publish script + published test post; tightened verification (word count + headings) and fixed legacy posts to satisfy checks.
