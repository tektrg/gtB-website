# Schedule (Asia/Saigon)

Default nightly ship window: **00:30–02:00**
- Ship 1–2 tasks
- Run verification (build/check + SEO checks)
- Write a report: `AUTONOMUS/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Post a summary in this Telegram topic

If something is blocked, the nightly ship is a smaller “ops” task (automation, template, research) + unblock request.
