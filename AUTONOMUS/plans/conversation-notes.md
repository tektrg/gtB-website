# Conversation notes (persisted)

This file captures decisions made in Telegram so they persist in the repo.

## 2026-02-03
- **Target persona:** Power users
- **Primary keyword / cluster:** “BYOM AI extension”
- **Cadence:** ask for input during the day; do actual work at night when Trung is not using the computer
  - Daytime check-ins: ~11:00 and ~17:00 (Asia/Saigon)
  - Nightly ship window: ~02:05 (Asia/Saigon)
- **Tooling preference:**
  - Use **Gemini CLI** for research/search
  - Use **Qwen CLI** for drafting/rewrite (free quota)
  - **Do not use Ollama**
- **Content quality requirements:**
  - Add 2–3 new internal links to newer posts (inside article body)
  - Conversion blocks in every article body:
    - “Try this in GPT Breeze” callout with steps
    - “Add to Chrome” CTA early-ish
    - mini FAQ at bottom (targets PAA)
  - Terminology consistency: pick one primary acronym per page (BYOM vs BYOK); mention the other once as alias
