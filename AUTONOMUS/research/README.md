# AUTONOMUS Research

This folder stores **research artifacts** that must exist before AUTONOMUS publishes an SEO article.

Why:
- We don’t want the daily blog to publish generic posts based only on assumptions.
- Research artifacts capture user discussions, keywords, and backlink plans.

Layout:
- `AUTONOMUS/research/blog/<topicId>.md` — research for a blog topic in `AUTONOMUS/content/topic-bank.json`

Rule:
- If research is missing for the next topic, the blog publisher should refuse to publish.
