### Notes (quotes/snippets)

- People want summarization **embedded into YouTube** + "jump to timestamp" behaviors, not a separate app/tab. (chrome_extensions thread)
- Cost becomes a real constraint when users try to summarize long podcasts (1h+) in one go. (chrome_extensions thread)
- Users look for a summarizer that they "keep going back to" and that works for **long** videos. (ChatGPT thread)
- PKMS users care about incorporating YouTube links + timestamps into their note systems and keep shopping around when the workflow is awkward. (PKMS thread)

### Pain points

- "I don’t want to watch the whole thing" — but I still need the important parts.
- Plain summaries are not enough: people want **timestamps** so they can verify and jump.
- Long videos are expensive/time-consuming to summarize in one shot.
- Workflow friction: too many tools, too many tabs, no fast way to turn summaries into notes.
