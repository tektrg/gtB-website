# AUTONOMUS (Iris) — gptB-website

This folder is Iris’ autonomous co-founder workspace for **gptbreeze.io**.

## Goal
Ship 1–2 growth improvements per day (SEO + content ops + automation), with **verifiable** outputs.

## Structure
- `plans/` — roadmap + schedule
- `data/` — task DB (pillars/posts/landing pages)
- `scripts/` — generators + verifiers
- `reports/` — daily shipped reports (evidence included)

## Rules
- Every task produces a report under `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- No “trust me”: include checks (sitemap, internal links, frontmatter, build output).
