Transcripts are exhaustive. Summaries are useful. Here’s when to use each, and how to combine them into a faster workflow.

## What people actually struggle with

- Transcript alone is too long; summary alone is too vague.
- People want to *verify quickly* → timestamps + transcript context.
- Searching a transcript is great for finding a moment; summarizing is great for understanding the whole.

## The difference: raw text vs compressed meaning

Here’s the practical version of **The difference: raw text vs compressed meaning**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

A simple way to avoid noise:

- Start with a short summary.
- Then ask for one specific output (checklist / decision / action items).
- Save the prompt as a shortcut once it works.

Reusable output format:

```text
Summary (5 bullets):
Key takeaways:
Action items:
Questions to clarify:
Relevant links/sections to re-check:
```

## The hybrid workflow (recommended)

A simple routine that works for most teams:

1. Create a dedicated provider key for your BYOM tool.
2. Use a redaction checklist for any pasted content.
3. Keep "money pages" linked in relevant posts (e.g. `/pricing`).
4. Re-run an SEO hygiene check before publishing.

If you're deciding between BYOM and subscriptions, start with `/pricing` and pick based on your risk tolerance and budget predictability.

Copy/paste checklist:

- Key stored? (where, how, who has access)
- Page access limited? (only needed sites)
- Sensitive data redacted? (PII, tokens, internal links)
- Export/share safe? (no keys, no raw dumps)
- Logs reviewed? (no prompt dumps in logs)

## Privacy notes

Here’s the practical version of **Privacy notes**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

Privacy checklist (fast):

- Don’t paste keys/tokens/cookies. Replace with placeholders.
- Don’t paste internal URLs or customer identifiers.
- Prefer summarize-first: summarize sensitive docs into neutral bullets, then rewrite from bullets.

If privacy is a priority, follow the stricter workflow on [/privacy-first](/privacy-first).

## FAQ

Here’s the practical version of **FAQ**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

Quick answers:

- **Will the summary be perfect?** No—treat it as a draft, then ask targeted follow-ups.
- **How do I keep it private?** Don’t paste secrets; use placeholders + summarize-first.
- **Where do I start?** [/guide/getting-started/](/guide/getting-started/) is the fastest path.
- **What about video?** Use [/youtube-summary](/youtube-summary) workflows.
