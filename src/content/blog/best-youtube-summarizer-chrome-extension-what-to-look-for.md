A buyer’s guide for picking a YouTube summarizer extension: timestamps, transcript access, privacy/BYOK, and cost control.

## What people actually struggle with

- Most tools give a blob summary with no timestamps → hard to verify.
- Long videos: either too expensive or too slow.
- People want something they’ll keep using (low friction, inside YouTube).
- Trust: privacy, BYOK, and not sending everything to unknown servers.

## The 6 features that actually matter

Here’s the practical version of **The 6 features that actually matter**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

Evaluation checklist:

- Output quality: does it capture the right level of detail?
- Speed: can you get a first pass in under a minute?
- Timestamps/transcripts (for video): do you get clickable sections?
- Cost control: subscription vs BYOK/BYOM.
- Privacy: what data is stored, and where?

If you want predictable tradeoffs, start at [/pricing](/pricing).

## Privacy & BYOK: what good looks like

Here’s the practical version of **Privacy & BYOK: what good looks like**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

Privacy checklist (fast):

- Don’t paste keys/tokens/cookies. Replace with placeholders.
- Don’t paste internal URLs or customer identifiers.
- Prefer summarize-first: summarize sensitive docs into neutral bullets, then rewrite from bullets.

If privacy is a priority, follow the stricter workflow on [/privacy-first](/privacy-first). If cost predictability matters, compare approaches on [/pricing](/pricing).
