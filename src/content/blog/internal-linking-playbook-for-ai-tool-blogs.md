A lightweight internal-linking system to improve crawlability and conversions without bloating your content.

Internal linking is one of the highest leverage SEO moves because you control it completely. The trick is to be systematic so links help users (and Google) without turning posts into spam.

## Pick 3 money pages

Choose 3 pages you want to rank and convert. For GPT Breeze, good defaults are:

- `/pricing` (intent: comparison and purchase)
- `/privacy-first` (intent: trust and differentiation)
- `/youtube-summary` (intent: feature + use case)

Every new post should link to at least 1 money page when it is contextually relevant.

## Define 5 recurring anchors

Create a small set of natural anchors you can reuse across posts:

- "privacy-first workflow" -> `/privacy-first`
- "compare plans" -> `/pricing`
- "summarize YouTube videos" -> `/youtube-summary`
- "model cost calculator" -> `/ai-model-cost-calculator-and-price-comparation`
- "getting started" -> `/guide/getting-started/`

This avoids random anchors and creates consistent topical signals.

## Where links belong in a post

Simple placement rules:

- Early: 1 contextual link near the intro (high visibility).
- Middle: links inside checklists and comparisons (highest intent).
- End: 1 strong CTA link (conversion).

Avoid footers packed with 10 links. It looks spammy and users ignore it.

## How to keep it consistent

Make it part of publishing:

1. Add a final "internal links" pass before publishing.
2. Keep a small anchor list in your notes (or in `AUTONOMUS/plan.md`).
3. Run `npm run seo:verify` so every post meets the same baseline quality bar.
