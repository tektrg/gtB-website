A step-by-step workflow to turn long YouTube videos into clickable, time-stamped notes you can scan and revisit.

## What people actually struggle with

- "I don’t want to watch the whole thing" — but I still need the important parts.
- Plain summaries are not enough: people want **timestamps** so they can verify and jump.
- Long videos are expensive/time-consuming to summarize in one shot.
- Workflow friction: too many tools, too many tabs, no fast way to turn summaries into notes.

## When timestamp summaries beat plain bullet summaries

Here’s the practical version of **When timestamp summaries beat plain bullet summaries**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

A simple way to avoid noise:

- Start with a short summary.
- Then ask for one specific output (checklist / decision / action items).
- Save the prompt as a shortcut once it works.

Reusable output format:

```text
Summary (5 bullets):
Key takeaways:
Action items:
Questions to clarify:
Relevant links/sections to re-check:
```

## Step-by-step: timestamp summary workflow in GPT Breeze

A simple routine that works for most teams:

1. Create a dedicated provider key for your BYOM tool.
2. Use a redaction checklist for any pasted content.
3. Keep "money pages" linked in relevant posts (e.g. `/pricing`).
4. Re-run an SEO hygiene check before publishing.

If you're deciding between BYOM and subscriptions, start with `/pricing` and pick based on your risk tolerance and budget predictability.

Copy/paste checklist:

- Key stored? (where, how, who has access)
- Page access limited? (only needed sites)
- Sensitive data redacted? (PII, tokens, internal links)
- Export/share safe? (no keys, no raw dumps)
- Logs reviewed? (no prompt dumps in logs)

## Prompt templates for timestamped summaries

Here’s the practical version of **Prompt templates for timestamped summaries**—the goal is to get a usable output in one session, not to overthink tooling.

What to aim for:

- A short answer first (so you can decide fast).
- A structured breakdown (so you can trust what you’re reading).
- Actionable next steps (so it turns into progress, not notes).
- Links back to the source sections (for quick verification).

Copy/paste prompt templates:

```text
Summarize this into 8 bullets. Focus on decisions, numbers, and action items.
Then give me 3 follow-up questions I should ask next.
```

```text
Extract the key claims and supporting evidence. Mark uncertain parts as "needs verification".
Output: (1) claims, (2) evidence, (3) counterpoints, (4) my next steps.
```

```text
Turn this into a 5-sentence executive summary + a checklist I can execute in 30 minutes.
```

Reusable output format:

```text
Summary (5 bullets):
Key takeaways:
Action items:
Questions to clarify:
Relevant links/sections to re-check:
```
