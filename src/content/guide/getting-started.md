# Getting Started with GPT Breeze

Welcome to GPT Breeze! This guide will introduce you to the core concepts that make GPT Breeze a powerful and flexible AI companion for your browsing experience.

## Core Concepts

### üîë Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)

GPT Breeze operates on a **"Bring Your Own Model"** approach, which means:

- **No vendor lock-in**: Choose from various AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and more
- **Pay-as-you-use**: Only pay for what you actually use, no monthly subscriptions
- **Privacy-focused**: Your API keys stay on your device, and conversations go directly to your chosen provider
- **Full control**: Switch between different models based on your needs and budget

### üóùÔ∏è API Keys

API keys are your credentials to access AI services:

**What they are:**
- Unique identifiers that allow you to authenticate with AI providers
- Think of them as "passwords" for AI services
- Required for most premium AI models

**How to get them:**
- **OpenAI**: Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) ‚Üí API Keys
- **Anthropic**: Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) ‚Üí API Keys  
- **Google**: Visit [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev) ‚Üí Get API Key
- **OpenRouter**: Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) ‚Üí Keys

**Cost considerations:**
- Most providers offer free credits for new users
- Pay only for tokens you use (typically $0.001-0.03 per 1K tokens)
- Much cheaper than monthly AI subscriptions for moderate usage
